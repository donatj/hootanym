# HootaNym

This is intended as a spiritual successor to the [Proven](https://github.com/dschep/proven) Chrome extension.

It is a Chrome extension that reads usernames from pages it runs on and uses Keybase's identity API to provide additional context about user identities.

It currently only handles Hacker News, but other sites will be added in the future.
