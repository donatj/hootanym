## 1. Introduction

This privacy policy applies to the Chrome extension HootaNym. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 2. Data Collection and Use

HootaNym reads usernames from pages it runs on and uses Keybase's identity API to provide additional context about user identities.
